# Proactive Computer Security 2017


## Welcome
Dear Students,

Welcome to the course Proactive Computer Security.

The first lecture is on Tuesday, April 25, in HCØ Aud 01 at 10:00.

We will start to populate this course-room with information about the course shortly. When the information starts to tickle in please look around and let us know if you find any broken links, or if something simply looks wrong. Some key information, such as the lecture plan and assignment schedule, is still being finalized, but will be added shortly.

This year we'll be using "New Absalon" for the first time, thus the ride might be a bit bumpy. (For newcomers to the University of Copenhagen, our old learning portal was also called Absalon, hence the New/Old moniker.)

The discussion forum is the main line of communication, because it automatically goes to all of the teaching team.

Cheers,

PCS Teaching Team



## Remember Meet'N'Group
Just a friendly reminder that there is a Meet'N'Group in Aud 6, HCØ.

Kristoffer and I will be there from 10:15, to answer questions about dates, the list of suggested topics, and life in general.



## New Deadlines
Two things:

I have changes the deadline for the presentation sign-up so that it is at 13:00 (rather than 23:59) tomorrow (Friday). It is my plan to make the schedule for the presentations tomorrow afternoon. Again, the most important part right now is to form the groups and decide the dates. You'll be able to change topics later if you want to.
A few of you failed to hand in the first assignment for various reasons. I have (tried?) to make the first assignment available again so that you get a second chance to hand in. Write me an email if it doesn't work for you.


## Plan for student presentations
The plan for the student presentations is now ready.

Please check that I got everything right. If your topic is marked with "??" I expect you to send me a topic soonish (or book a meeting with me so I can help you find a topic).

If you want an other date, you'll have to find an other group to swap with. If you want an other topic then come and talk to me and then send me an email.

Have a nice weekend.


## Grading
Some of you have asked how exactly the course is graded, and whether you must pass all assignments to pass the course. The purpose of this announcement is to clarify how the grading is done. If you have questions then don’t hesitate to start a new discussion.

It is possible to skip one or two assignments and still pass the course, but your grade will suffer.

The rough formula we use when discussing your grade is:

    sum(best_5_of(assignment1 to assignment6)) + presentation + w*assignment7 + extra_credit

where `w` is a constant ]1;2]. By “rough formula” I mean that the number that the formula spits out is the offset for Kristoffer’s and my discussion when we try to decide a grade for you.

Thus, each of the first six assignments counts for ~ 1/8 of the grade.

If we disregard the `extra_credit` then the formula will spew out a number between 0 and 24, which we will then try to map to a grade on the 7 step scale. The passing cut-off will be around 7, corresponding to getting 1 point in each assignment. However, the grade is based on a holistic view giving priority to consistency. That is, you might not pass even if you have 7 points, if you have not demonstrated that you master an important learning objective like, say, writing shellcode.

What is the extra credit then about? We have an extra file where we note if a student does something that we cannot give proper credit for with the regular points. For example, ending up between two grades in an assignment or go beyond what is expected for an assignment or presentation. (Sometimes the extra credit is negative.)


## RPS version 2
Snowstorm has made version 2 of the RPS server available for us, including an updated version of the support file (now with the AI that Kristoffer has made for you).

It is already deployed at rps.incorrectness.dk port 4242.


## RPS version 2.1
A minor bug made it in to new features in version 2. Snowstorm has fixed this bug and have released version 2.1 and have updated the support files.


## ROP Assignment and Final Assignment deadline changes
Hey everyone,

Due to the delay in getting the ROP assignment ready (sorry!), the deadline for handing it in will be extended for everyone by 24 hours.

The final assignment release will probably be late as well, and its deadline will be similarly extended if needed.

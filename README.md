# Proactive Computer Security 2017

WELCOME
====
Dear Students,

Welcome to the course Proactive Computer Security.

The first lecture is on Tuesday, April 25, in HCØ Aud 01 at 10:00.

We will start to populate this course-room with information about the course shortly. When the information starts to tickle in please look around and let us know if you find any broken links, or if something simply looks wrong. Some key information, such as the lecture plan and assignment schedule, is still being finalized, but will be added shortly.

This year we'll be using "New Absalon" for the first time, thus the ride might be a bit bumpy. (For newcomers to the University of Copenhagen, our old learning portal was also called Absalon, hence the New/Old moniker.)

The discussion forum is the main line of communication, because it automatically goes to all of the teaching team.

Cheers,

PCS Teaching Team



REMEMBER MEET'N'GROUP
====

Just a friendly reminder that there is a Meet'N'Group in Aud 6, HCØ.

Kristoffer and I will be there from 10:15, to answer questions about dates, the list of suggested topics, and life in general.



NEW DEADLINES
====  

Two things:

I have changes the deadline for the presentation sign-up so that it is at 13:00 (rather than 23:59) tomorrow (Friday). It is my plan to make the schedule for the presentations tomorrow afternoon. Again, the most important part right now is to form the groups and decide the dates. You'll be able to change topics later if you want to.
A few of you failed to hand in the first assignment for various reasons. I have (tried?) to make the first assignment available again so that you get a second chance to hand in. Write me an email if it doesn't work for you.
